"""Where saved work lands: a save root, calendar days, and unique names.

Everything saved on a given day starts under a folder named for that day --
``<save_root>/2026_08_05/``.  An ordinary Save can allocate a unique file there;
a long-running Task can allocate a unique directory there and own everything
inside it.  A physicist still finds the work by date, while one Task run remains
one copyable and failure-retaining unit.

Date routing lives here, beside atomic writing and escape-safe path resolution,
because they are one concern: deciding where a file goes and putting it there
without leaving a half-written or stray file behind.  Nothing else in the
workspace may compute a save path.
