"""WHEELTEC N100 nine-axis IMU, read off its FDILink serial stream.

The module talks first: from the moment it has power it emits binary
FDILink packets on its serial port at the rate it was configured to (the
factory default is 100 Hz).  One IMU packet carries the three gyroscope
axes, the three accelerometer axes, the three magnetometer axes, the die
temperature, the barometer pair and the module's own microsecond clock, so
this source publishes four quantities from one record column set.

What is published is what the packet says, in units the registry knows:
the magnetometer's milligauss become microtesla (one milligauss is a tenth
of a microtesla), the die temperature in celsius becomes kelvin, the rates
and accelerations pass through in radians per second and metres per second
squared.  The sample interval is not assumed from the datasheet: it is
measured off the module's own packet clock when the port is opened, which
is also how a module set to a different rate is found out.

A frame proves itself.  Its 7-byte header carries a CRC8 over the header
and a CRC16 over the payload, and both are checked before a single number
is believed -- so a packet type this driver does not publish is stepped
over by the length the module itself stated, a corrupted frame is dropped
rather than published as a magnetic field, and no table in this file has
to hold a payload length that a firmware revision could falsify.  (The
vendor's own material gives three different lengths for the INS/GPS
packet, which is exactly the trap a length table walks into.)

Opening this source asks the module NOTHING.  The rate is measured off
the stream that is already arriving -- those packets are what every record
gets stamped with, so they are the truth about the rate, and a trip
through the console would cost seconds to be told something less true.

The console is entered only to WRITE, when the operator changes the rate
in Device Control.  ``console.py`` speaks it; entering stops the stream,
so the reader is parked for the round trip, and what the module comes back
DOING is read off the stream afterwards rather than asked for.
