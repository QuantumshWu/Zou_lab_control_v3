"""The slice of ZishuTech's libdaq2 this driver speaks, bound with ctypes.

The vendor ships a Python wrapper of its own; this is not it.  That wrapper
loads the DLL at IMPORT time from a path inside its own package, which would
make merely listing this bench's device types fail on a machine without the
card -- and it has no argument types, so a wrong Python int reaches the
board as whatever the C compiler made of it.  This binding declares every
signature, resolves the DLL through the bench's one vendor rule, and is
opened only when a device is.

The library is a process-wide singleton addressed by device serial: there is
no handle, and two objects naming one serial are one card to it.  So the
serial IS the identity the installation's broker guards.
