"""A ZishuTech DAQ-4211 acquisition card as a waveform source.

The card is eight single-ended 16-bit inputs sampled SYNCHRONOUSLY at one
rate, over USB, with a software trigger and no external one (UG0015 §5.2).
So one record is one block of that stream: ``record_samples`` per channel,
every channel taken at the same instant, and the card's own sample clock is
the record's time.

What the card cannot know is what is WIRED to each input.  A Stefan Mayer
FLC 100 answers ±1 V per 50 µT about a 2.5 V reference, and three of them
are a magnetic field in microtesla, not three volts: so each authored
channel says which quantity it carries, in which unit, and the volts-to-unit
conversion of the thing plugged into it.  That is a fact about the bench,
which is exactly what a device configuration is for -- and it is why this
source publishes ``magnetic_field`` in µT beside the N100's, rather than
volts nobody can compare.
