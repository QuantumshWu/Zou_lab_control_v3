"""The virtual RF source: the Vaunix driver over an in-memory library.

Per the bench's one virtualization rule, the fake is the LOWEST layer only:
this is the real ``VaunixLmsRfSource`` -- its unit conversions, its grid
refusals, its read-back discipline, its epochs -- driven over a library
that keeps the registers in a dict instead of a USB brick.  A detuning scan
rehearsed against this device exercises every line the real one will run.

    """The vendor DLL's slice, holding its integers in memory.

    A brick REMEMBERS.  Its registers survive being closed and opened
    again, because the instrument on the bench is still emitting whatever
    it was emitting when the software let go of it -- and a simulation
    that forgets on open cannot express the one state that matters here:
    an instrument already set up, which connecting must not disturb.  They
    survive for as long as this LIBRARY does: the virtual bench builds one
    per Init (``virtual_rf_source``), so a device initialized again finds
    its brick at power-up, as if it had been unplugged in between; a test
    that means an instrument left set up opens a second source on the same
    library.

    It powers up standing INSIDE its own range -- at the bottom of it, RF
    off -- as a real brick does: a synthesizer cannot stand at 0 Hz, and a
    scan that promises to hand every knob back where it found it refuses a
    knob it could never command back there.
