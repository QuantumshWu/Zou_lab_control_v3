"""The SLM over a socket: the packet protocol, the server and the client.

The X15213 is plugged into the machine that stands beside it, and the bench
that drives it is another machine.  So this device is installed as a client
of a small server that owns the USB adapter: the protocol below is the whole
of that arrangement -- framing, the request vocabulary, the server loop and
the adapter the bench holds.  The phase contract it carries is the family's
(``canonical_phase``); everything here is this device's.
