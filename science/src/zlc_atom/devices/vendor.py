"""Vendor files live WITH the device family that needs them.

Bench-wide rule (user decree): a driver that needs a vendor artifact -- a
DLL, an SDK -- looks in the ``vendor/`` folder beside its own module, and
nowhere magic.  The operator either copies the file into that folder or
writes its absolute path into ``vendor/vendor.json``; a missing artifact is
reported as exactly that instruction, never as a bare "not found" against
a path nobody can see or change.
