"""How a selected region meets the grid a sensor is willing to take.

A sensor can only start and end a region on the steps it declares, so a box
drawn on an image is never exactly the box a camera takes.  Which way it is
rounded is a choice, and it is the SAME choice for every sensor -- so it is
made once, here, and each adapter supplies its own grid rather than its own
answer.

It was made twice, in opposite directions.  The qCMOS adapter covered the
request; the Basler adapter rounded the size down, so on a Width increment of
4 a requested 1918 became 1916 and the right-hand columns of the selected
region were never read out -- silently, because the applied region is what
everything downstream then measures.  Both adapters implement the same
``CameraAdapter.set_roi``, driven by the same authored roi_x/roi_y/roi_width/
roi_height and the same image-area selector, so the operator's box changed
meaning with the camera behind it.
