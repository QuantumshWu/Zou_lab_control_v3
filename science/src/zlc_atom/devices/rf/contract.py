"""The device-independent RF source surface every implementation answers.

An RF source is, to this system, its TUNABLE SURFACE: every source has per
output channel a carrier frequency, a power and an output switch, and a
concrete source may declare further real knobs such as a DG4000's FSK hop.
All are read and written through the same duck-typed quartet every tunable
device speaks (``tunable_fields`` / ``tune`` / ``tunable_values`` /
``settings_provenance``).  A scan axis, the generic control panel and the
device-axis executor all consume exactly that quartet, so the capability
Protocol IS the quartet -- there is no second, RF-only vocabulary for a
consumer to learn.

CHANNELS ARE THE DEVICE'S OWN STRUCTURE.  One instrument is one installed
instance whatever its channel count -- a two-channel generator is not two
devices to manage, it is one device with both channels' knobs.  A
single-channel source keeps the bare field names (``frequency``); a
multi-channel one prefixes them with its own channel names
(``ch1_frequency``), so the add-axis combo and the control panel show every
knob of the one instrument under its one card.

TWO FENCES, ONE RANGE.  A knob is bounded by the instrument's own limits,
read from the device when the connection opens, and by an optional bench
policy window, authored at Init and adjustable on the control panel.  What
may be COMMANDED -- by the panel, by a notebook, by a scan -- is the
tighter of the two on each side, so a scan range exists whenever the
instrument has a range, and a missing policy edge never forbids a sweep.
The instrument's limits are exposed beside the effective bounds
(``TunableField.device_limits``) so the panel can show which fence bites.

What varies between instruments is the transport underneath (SCPI text over
VISA for a bench generator, a vendor DLL for a Lab Brick) and the value grid
the hardware quantizes to.  Both live in the concrete drivers; the shared
plumbing here owns the rules that must not fork per driver:

* a write is SET-THEN-READ-BACK, and ``tune`` returns what the instrument
  itself reports, never what was asked;
* a value is written as the instrument's nearest grid point and ``tune``
  reports the point it landed on: setpoint and readback are different facts
  the scan records apart (scan/devices.py), so a rounding is never a refusal
  -- a scan's coordinates carry binary noise (1234.56 MHz is
  1234559999.9999998 Hz) that no grid check may judge;
* a bound is met within that same noise: a value a rounding past an edge it
  was authored on is that edge;
* ``settings_epoch`` compares the actual write result with the session's
  latest known value. It requires no extra device query or saved history.
  Explicit Refresh adopts external front-panel changes.
