"""Scan schema and placement planning over Runtime-owned committed chunks.

Seamless Scan writes here.  Its board axes advance inside a fire and its host
axes between fires; who moves the plan from point to point differs, what a
point MEANS in the data does not.

The plan's coordinates are known before any data.  Once the first source event
supplies its schema, this module computes the fixed scan schema and the slice
where each later event belongs.  Runtime owns the chunks, invalid future cells,
current materialization and terminal seal; this module never copies full scan
history.

REPEAT AND SHOTS PER POINT ARE DISTINCT REPEAT-DOMAIN FACTS. Adjacent trials
at one point are inner; walking the whole plan again is outer. Their names
describe the authored scan, not the board counters used by a particular mode.
The source's one-shot Repeat carrier is consumed, not duplicated in the result.

The dataset's axes ARE the plan's axes, carrying each port's name and unit.
That identity is what makes a saved scan self-describing, and it is the hook
everything later hangs from: a box drawn on the plot's x axis is a range of
``pulse:param:da_bias_x``, because the axis says so.
