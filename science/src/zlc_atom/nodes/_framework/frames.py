"""Which frames of a cycle each entry of an assignment reads.

An occupancy reads a load frame and a readout frame with calibrations trained
on each.  The operator says it the way they think it -- THIS file reads the
first frame, THAT one the last, ANOTHER the rest -- so an assignment is a list
of entries, each claiming frames.  The two ends of a cycle are named by what
they ARE, the frames between them by their number:

* ``"first"``, the first frame of the cycle -- frame 0, in every cycle (a
  claim written as frame 0 IS this claim, and is stored as ``"first"``);
* ``"last"``, whatever the last frame of the cycle is;
* a positive number, a MIDDLE frame strictly between the first and the last
  (the numbering the camera, Frame Survival and the Calibration task use);
* ``"rest"``, every frame no entry names.

An entry claiming no frame is PARKED: it stays in the assignment, reads
nothing and is checked against nothing (:func:`parked_entries`) -- a file
the operator keeps at hand is not a file they must use.  Only an assignment
in which every entry is parked is refused.

A cycle that gains or loses a frame keeps meaning what was authored: the
ends follow the cycle, a middle number keeps its position, and a middle
number the shorter cycle no longer has between its ends is ABSENT -- it
never takes over the last frame, reads nothing in this cycle and is noted
(:func:`absent_notes`), not refused.  A frame is read by exactly one entry.
Only "rest" ranks below anything else: every other collision -- two entries
reaching one frame ("first" and "last" in a one-frame cycle), a frame nobody
reads -- is refused with the entries named, never settled silently.  One
entry reaching a frame two ways is one reader.  Nothing here ever edits what
was authored: an absent number reads its frame again once a frame count that
has it returns.
