"""What a calibration found, in the numbers an operator judges it by.

A calibration writes a large artifact -- every site's centre, every model's
weights, every threshold -- and a folder of pictures.  Neither answers the
first question anyone asks of it: how well does it read out, and which model
should the next measurement use?  Those numbers were all computed and none of
them were stated; an operator had to open a picture and read them off the
annotations, per site, per model.

This is that statement.  One dictionary, written beside the pictures, holding
what each model achieves and what it cost -- and nothing that is not measured
here, so there is no second place for it to disagree with.
