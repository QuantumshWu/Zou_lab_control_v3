    bound stops a step and never turns it round -- is drawn from the
    ``givers`` -- the loaded sites whose own step this candidate is not UP:

    RESOLUTION STEP (``_PLANT_EXCITATION_LOG_STEP``) below its current share

    ``takers``, the loaded sites whose step is not DOWN, each able to rise
    one resolution above its current share and never past its bracket
    ceiling.  Every giver parts with the same fraction of
    what it can give, so the cost is spread over all of them; when they
    cannot cover the whole request the directed sites receive what there
    is, pro rata, in their own direction.  The transfer is exact, so the
    total is conserved to the last bit, and nothing here moves a site

    site the loop had just sent UP by 1% -- its recorded step said up, its
    actual share went down -- and when the common factor had no root the

    site's own loading margin is unknown until it has shown an edge, and

    many times the margin a marginally loaded array has.  Measured on the

    under the clamp pressed twenty-two loaded ones dark in one candidate
    and the run crawled back at one bracket bisection per candidate; at
    the resolution the loaded sites still hand over a good part of a

    A bracket is one site's evidence about where its loading edge lies: the
    share it was last seen single at, the share it was last seen loaded at,
    and the direction from the first to the second.  EVERY measured
    candidate is evidence -- a diagnostic probe as much as a formal one --
    and THE LATEST OBSERVATION WINS: the edge drifts with the rest of the
    lattice (the solver redistributes, the reference mean moves; on the
    virtual lattice by ~5% over ten candidates), so a bound is the most
    recent share the site showed that state at, never the tightest ever
    seen.  A loaded site pressed dark by the compensation for somebody
    else's share is exactly a site that has just shown where its edge is:
    that goes into its bracket and its next step goes back towards the
    share it was loaded at.

    The direction is the probe verdict's (or, seeded here, the prior's:
    deeper loads) and ONLY a verdict changes it.  A dark observation cannot
    say which side of its loading window a site is on, and the rule that
    turned a site round whenever it was dark beyond its loaded bound sent
    three virtual sites ping-ponging between two shares for the rest of
    the run: "loaded at 1.05" was a marginal loading the ramp had since
    moved past, and the flip made it a ceiling.

    Rules, in order:
    - a loaded site records the share as its loaded bound; a single bound
      on the loaded side of it is stale and dropped;
    - a dark site with no bracket seeds one from the last share it was
      loaded at (see ``previous_weights``);
    - a dark site beyond its loaded bound by more than the resolution has
      contradicted that bound: it is dropped, and the site records the
      share as its single bound and keeps creeping in its direction
      (``_single_bracket_step``);
    - otherwise a dark site records the share as its single bound; dark
      within a resolution of the loaded share it has FOUND the edge and
      steps one resolution past it.

    The resolution is the identification excitation
    (``_PLANT_EXCITATION_LOG_STEP``): the SLM Target is wiggled by that much
    while the plant is identified, so no bracket can be resolved finer.

    held on its ramp or without a reference.  The update is then done in
    SHARE space over the sites that have a direction: the balanced trades
    (``_allocate_requested_shares``) and the funding (``_funded_shares``)
    each conserve the total exactly and move a site only in its own
    direction, and a held site is not written at all, so after
    normalisation every site's absolute share of the fixed total power has
    changed with its intended sign -- or, when the other side has nothing
    to give, not at all: the step shrinks, it never turns.  A loaded site
    the loop asks nothing of has no direction of its own and lends itself
    to the funding either way; its recorded correction is then that
    movement.  A site that is held keeps its absolute share to the
    Target's precision, which is what "hold" means physically; a raw
    weight that stayed put while the total moved was not holding anything.

    A loaded site on its loading ramp (``loading_edge``, see
    ``_loading_edge``) has no share to give: its own step is held at zero
    when it points shallower (``hold_loading_edge``) and neither the
    ordinary trades nor the funding may take it below its current share.
    The site that ping-ponged for twenty candidates on the virtual lattice
    was one loaded at a 15% bright fraction and then handed 2% to a dark
    neighbour: dark the next candidate, and back on the probe treadmill.

    ``feedback_gain`` is the LOOP gain: the fraction of each site's log
    residual the next candidate is asked to remove.  Dividing by the
    measured ``plant_slope`` magnitude turns that into the weight step which
    does it; with no trusted slope the step assumes unit slope at half gain
    (see ``_usable_plant_slope``).  The step goes AGAINST the plant's sign
    (``plant_sign``): a site reading above the reference gets more weight
    when more weight lowers the observable, less when it raises it.  Every step is then scaled by the fit
    quality, clamped to ``maximum_weight_change`` and passed through the
    share-conserving allocator, so the recorded correction is what was
    actually applied.

    A dark site with a direction (``directed_log_step``: a probe verdict, a
    bracket bisection or an extrapolation) asks for that share outright --
    the request is not the loop's, so neither gain nor clamp applies to it.
    THE LOADED SITES NOT GOING THE OTHER WAY FUND IT, TOGETHER AND BOUNDED:
    whatever the balanced trades leave unmet is drawn from the loaded sites
    the loop is not sending up -- their own step down, or nothing asked of
    them -- and handed, for a directed decrease, to the ones it is not
    sending down; a held site is neither.  Each gives at most one
    resolution step in this candidate and never crosses its own bracket
    boundary (``control_boundary``; see ``_funded_shares``).  Total power
    is the hard constraint; how fast a dark site gets there is not.  Direct
    adoption of a winning probe share used to rescale the loaded sites by
    whatever it took (-40% at once), which pressed every one of them past
    its loading edge at 4% margin; and a bracket step with nobody assigned
    to pay for it moved ~1% per candidate, the crumbs of the loop's own
    residual trades.  What cannot be funded this candidate is asked for
    again next candidate.  Without a directed site this is exactly the
    balanced allocation.

        never disagree about what was chosen.  The failure path used to skip

        candidate 66 of 68 died on one pulse poll with an empty ``final/``
        and the SLM showing the phase it started from.

        The artifact is the deliverable, the figures are the report, and a
        report that fails must not take the deliverable with it: the figures
        are written after the artifact, and a figure writer that raises does
        not raise out of the seal.  It is recorded in the summary, told to
        the operator, and noted on the run's error when there is one.
        Letting it out of here made the failure handler seal the same
        candidate a second time, fail at the same figures, and then restore
        the incoming phase -- ``final/`` claiming candidate 3 with the SLM on
