"""What a number means, and the one way it is shown to a person.

Units live HERE, in the bottom layer, because a unit is a fact about data --
what the number in this column is -- and not about drawing it.  They used to
live in ``zlc_plot``, which meant the layer that compiles a pulse could not
see them and kept a second, smaller table of its own; the two disagreed about
the base (seconds against nanoseconds), about spelling (this one accepts
``µs``, that one did not), and about arithmetic.

**A prefix is not a unit.**  ``kHz`` was once a registry entry beside ``Hz``,
``MHz`` and ``GHz``, which made "show this in the next unit up" mean "look up
a different object" -- so nothing ever did it, and the table had holes wherever
nobody had typed the row (``kHz`` existed, ``mHz`` did not; ``um`` existed,
``pm`` did not).  Here the registry holds BASE units, one per dimension, plus
the handful that are genuinely their own thing, and every prefixed spelling is
derived on resolution.  Changing scale is then arithmetic on an exponent,
which is what lets one rule format ``120000000.0 Hz`` as ``120.0000000 MHz``
and read ``1.05M`` back.

**Showing a number never changes it.**  The stored value is always in the
unit its owner declared; a prefix is chosen when the string is built and
forgotten immediately after.  This is the same discipline that ``base`` and
``canonical`` had to be separated to get right, and it is why formatting here
shifts a decimal point instead of multiplying a float: shifting is exact, so
what is displayed is what is held, digit for digit.

    Everything the formatter can produce is accepted, and so is everything a
    person reasonably types instead: a bare number in the field's own unit,
    a prefix alone (``1.05M`` in a hertz field, a rung of the field's own
    family), a whole compatible unit (``1.05 MHz``, ``1050 kHz``), and ``u``
    wherever ``µ`` is shown.  The result is in ``unit``, never in the base,
    because the field's stored value is in its own unit and a parse that
    silently changed that would be the base-for-canonical mistake again.

    What the formatter showed is read back as the number it showed, bit for
    bit: between two spellings of one family the point is shifted back the
    way it was shifted out, in decimal, and only a foreign unit (degrees
    into radians, a level into watts) goes through float arithmetic.
    ``0.1 ns`` multiplied out as ``0.1 * 1e-9`` is 1.0000000000000002e-10,
    one ulp from the 1e-10 the box was showing.
